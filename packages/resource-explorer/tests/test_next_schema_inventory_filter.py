"""Schema Inventory tab's filter box and node-kind labels in /next
(Slice 22 follow-up, Dan's usability gate on `laz_local_adventureworks`,
2026-09-27).

Task 1 of the gate FAILED on the served page: with a filter typed (e.g.
"salesorderheader"), clicking a matched table's triangle opened nothing --
no column rows appeared, even though the same triangle showed columns with
no filter active. `filterSchemaTree()` used to test every `[data-tree-node]`
independently against `data-tree-text`, which for a schema/table used to be
the schema/table's own name PLUS every descendant name concatenated
together -- so a table "matched" via its concatenated text (which includes
the query as its own name), but its column rows (each carrying only their
own name) did not, and were hidden independently even though the table's
own `<details>` was open.

`schemaTreeHtml`/`tableHtml` now write `data-tree-text` as a node's OWN
name only (matching what column rows already did), and `filterSchemaTree`
was rewritten as a proper recursion (`filterTreeNode`/`directTreeChildren`)
implementing the gate's own rule: a node whose own name matches shows every
descendant unconditionally (but still collapsed, unless individually
opened); a node whose own name does not match but some descendant's does
stays visible with its own `<details>` forced open, and unmatched siblings
are hidden; a node with no match anywhere under it is hidden.

Also from the same gate: a clear (x) control for the filter box (task 2),
and quiet node-kind labels -- "schema"/"table"/"view"/"matview" -- so a
reader can tell a view from a base table without opening it (task 3).

No browser verification with a signed-in session is asserted here -- see
this branch's own report for what was verified live instead (a standalone
DOM harness in the built-in browser, not the authenticated app) -- same
static-source-assertion pattern test_next_db_server_discovery.py
established.
